# Drifter

Drifter is a set of convenience classes, implicits, and utility methods for use with [LibGDX][1].  I maintain this library 
for my personal use, mainly in [Ludum Dare][2] and other game jams.  The intention is to enable super rapid game development 
in Scala, with a strong preference for convenience and succinctness over performance or really anything else.

This library is very far from complete.  Some of the features are fairly half-baked and may be badly implemented.  Some may 
not work.   I only add features here when I need 'em for some project.  You're welcome to submit PRs, but I can't guarantee 
I'll merge frequently or at all.
